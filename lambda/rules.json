Be careful, loading multi-row is a kind of reading operation. \n- For other reading scenarios, must use the slave database.\n\nPlease check the methods in the all \"*Service\" to validate correct master-salve database design. You should recursively trace the code call chain to do deeper validation.\n\nPlease think through it step by step. Find incorrect design as much as possible. Finally give your conclusion in JSON format:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"level\": \"serious level\", \n    \"title\": \"summary your finding, less than 30 words\",\n    \"content\": \"your finding\", \n    \"filepath\": \"filepath @ line number range\"\n  },\n  { ... }, // other findings...\n  ...\n]\n```\n\nIn this JSON:\n- level, must be one of \"serious\", \"major\", \"trivial\"\n- title, use Chinese. The summary should be specific to the issue, not to the file, and should not be a vague statement.\n- content, use Chinese, must include why it is incorrect, provide evidence. must display code snippets in markdown code block. must tell how to improve. This part should be as much detail as possible, provide evidence to support your conclusion\n- filepath, such as a/b/c/e.java @ line 11-22\n\nHere is an good JSON example:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"level\": \"major\",\n        \"title\": \"导致系统崩溃的潜在安全漏洞\",\n        \"content\": \"在该文件中,我们发现了一个潜在的安全漏洞。\\n代码如下:\\n```java\\nif @condition) {\\n    doSomethingUnsafe();\\n}\\n```\\n这段代码可能会导致系统崩溃,因为在某些情况下,`doSomethingUnsafe()`方法可能会执行一些不安全的操作。我们建议修复这个问题\",\n        \"filepath\": \"src/main/java/com/example/App.java @line 45-50\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nYou must:\n- No preamble needed, no additional explanation is needed. Just give JSON output.\n- You will not display any correct interfaces. \n- Just tell the incorrect interfaces. \n- Note that single quotes and double quotes in JSON need to be escaped\n- Format the JSON output to one line\n- Use Chinese in field title and content, use English in other fields\n"
